At this stage of the project, exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the variables. Descriptive statistics were generated to examine each variable's measures of central tendency, variability, and to identify any potential errors, such as missing values or extreme outliers. Additionally, visualizations were created to assess skewness, identify outliers, and better understand the population represented in the sample data.

A key finding from this analysis was the potential overrepresentation of certain groups in the data, as the driving-related variables were significantly higher than expected for the average driver.
