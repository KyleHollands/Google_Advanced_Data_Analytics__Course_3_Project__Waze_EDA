# Exploratory Data Analysis on Driving Variables
## Project Overview
At this stage of the project, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the variables. Descriptive statistics were generated to examine each variable's measures of central tendency and variability, and to identify potential errors such as missing values or extreme outliers.  

Visualizations were also created to assess skewness, identify outliers, and better understand the population represented in the sample data.

## Data Understanding
The analysis highlighted that certain groups may be overrepresented in the dataset. Specifically, driving-related variables were significantly higher than expected for the average driver.

## Conclusion
The EDA suggests potential biases or overrepresentation in the dataset, which should be considered in subsequent modeling or analysis steps.
